## Design
### layout
for my layout, I chose a single page website displaying all information in a strategic method;
1. Introduction (getting to know the host)
2. Images/Gallery (Seeing the capability)
3. Prices (approximate guideline)
4. Contact form (Sending e-mails with their customisable enquiry)
5. Footer (to link over to social media's website.)

Following the above, I was able to create a template/wireframe for my website.

#### Color Scheme
