## Design
### layout
for my layout, I chose a single page website displaying all information in a strategic method;
1. Introduction (getting to know the host)
2. Images/Gallery (Seeing the capability)
3. Prices (approximate guideline)
4. Contact form (Sending e-mails with their customisable enquiry)
5. Footer (to link over to social media's website.)

Following the above, I was able to create a template/wireframe for my website.
    
- #### First Design, Mobile & Small Screens
    - <img src="assets\readme_images\mobiledesign.png" alt="design for mobile screens">
- #### Second Design (Tablets)
    - <img src="assets\readme_images\tabletdesign.png" alt="Design for tablet screens">
- #### Third Design (Large screens)
    - <img src="assets\readme_images\desktopdesign.png" alt="Design for desktop screens">
#### Color Scheme
As this website is created for my friend who has already created her profile with a dedicated facebook page. This resulted in a logo with specific colors created;

## Testings and Accessibility
- [Bugs found and Fixed]<br>
    - [x] form layout<br>
    - [x] Image Overlay<br>
        - In the introduction of image gallery, I created an animation overlay when pressing/hovering over an image. On my first attempt, I found the overlay covered the top segment of the website.<br>
<img src="assets\readme_images\overlay_fail.jpg" alt="overlay not showing on screen correctly" height=200px/><img src="assets\readme_images\overlay_correct.jpg" alt="Correction of overlay result" height=200px/><br>
This was fixed by adding additional container with relative position, as the primary div's were position:absolute.
